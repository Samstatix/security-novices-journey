Learning cybersecurity from scratch - documenting every exploit, defense, and tool
# Cybersecurity Learning Journey - From Zero to Security Practitioner


## ⚠️ Security First: Our Ethical Framework
1. **We only test systems we own or have explicit permission to test**
2. **We never attack production systems or networks without authorization**
3. **We document all learning in isolated lab environments**
4. **We respect privacy and legal boundaries at all times**

## 🎯 Our Starting Point (Week 1)
- ✅ Know basic programming
- ✅ Have computers with virtualization capability
- ❌ Don't know network security fundamentals
- ❌ Haven't used penetration testing tools
- ❌ No experience with exploit development
- ❌ Limited understanding of defensive security
